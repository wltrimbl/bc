      "\n",
      "In general, image data can be stored in either raster or vector graphics formats.  Vector graphics scale with the resolution of the device on which they are viewed, whereas the appearance of raster graphics is resolution dependent and cannot scale arbitrarily.  Vector graphics are typically used for graphical design applications whilst raster graphics are used for photographic images.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In this demonstration we will be concerned with raster graphics which are effectively a dot matrix of data.  As medical images may be optical or non-optical (e.g. X-ray) we will also discuss the coversion between colour and grayscale.  At each point in the matrix of a colour (RGB) raster image a red (R), green (G) and blue (B) value is stored.  \n",

This is the standard way a user would load an image for subsequent analysis and processing.  The second method is to access the built-in image available in the SciPy library; giving an easily accessible image for convenient on-the-fly testing of code you develop. "
